The script alarm.sh is a simple alarm clock with snooze function. The wakeup
time is requested of the user when the script is run and the snooze interval
is set as a value in the file.

The script buzzer.sh is called by alarm.sh to make the actual alarm sound. It
uses the mpg123 utility, and is currently able to play a hardcoded music file.

These scripts are in the public domain and free to use in any capacity for any purpose.
It's not my fault if you're late for work though.
